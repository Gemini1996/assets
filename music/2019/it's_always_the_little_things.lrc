[00:00.00]It's Always The Little Things - 郭顶/Rachael Yamagata (山形瑞秋)
[00:03.88]Lyrics by：郭顶/Rachael Yamagata
[00:07.76]Composed by：郭顶/Rachael Yamagata
[00:11.65]It&apos;s always the little things
[00:14.79]That seep into your soul
[00:20.74]How can I lie here still awake
[00:30.12]Something inside of me is telling me to go
[00:39.39]I&apos;ve been waiting to tell you so
[00:47.81]Mmm
[00:51.44]Take me home and make it right
[00:56.59]I long to see the light
[01:01.24]I&apos;m waiting for a sign
[01:07.25]And I don&apos;t know if we should part
[01:11.82]What does it mean if we give up
[01:16.54]How can I still feel this love for all that we&apos;ve been through
[01:25.33]And I don&apos;t know what I should say
[01:29.98]Is it the time to walk away
[01:34.51]Should we let go or should we stay
[01:38.97]And find a way through
[01:44.85]Mmm
[01:48.65]Take me home and make it right
[01:53.84]Can you still see the best of me
[01:57.86]Or am I falling out of sight
[02:09.18]It&apos;s always the hardest thing
[02:12.52]To listen to your soul
[02:18.28]When something is telling you to go
[02:27.79]A part of you wants to fight
[02:30.97]And part just fly away
[02:37.14]How I long to tell you so
[02:43.84]And I don&apos;t know if we should part
[02:48.48]What does it mean if we give up
[02:53.08]How can I still feel this love
[02:57.45]For all that we&apos;ve been through
[03:02.09]And is it time to walk away
[03:06.67]Should we let go or should we stay
[03:11.22]How do you know when something&apos;s too far gone to get back to
[03:21.66]Mmm
[03:25.42]Take me home and make it right
[03:30.69]Can you still see the best in me
[03:34.77]Or am I falling
[03:39.70]Am I falling
[03:44.41]Am I falling out of sight
